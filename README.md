# Decision-Tree-and-Its-Variance
# Introduction:
This notebook is used for applying machine learning models such as Decision Tree, XGBoost, Stacking,... to predict the possibility of heart disease on Cleveland Dataset and visualize important features in the prediction model.
# Usage:
- Download notebook: Project_Decision_Tree_XGBoost.ipynb
- Run the code from top to bottom to perform training with difference machine learning model and visualize important features
